To run this execute the script compileAndRun.sh

This code simulating a resturant with a waiters and customers.
I used semaphores to control and schedule the processes. you can also see that I used reader writers algorithm for this assignmment.

The main runs the restMng that take care of all the processes.

restMng inhariate from lickerMng that controlls semaphores

menu holds Dish
orderBoards holds customers

so this design for my opinion wasn't so good. but I kept it as it is for times reasons.
